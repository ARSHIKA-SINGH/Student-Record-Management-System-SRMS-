# 🎓 Student Record Management System (SRMS)

A **desktop-based Student Record Management System** built using **Python, Tkinter, and SQLite**.  
This application provides **role-based access** for Admin and Students to efficiently manage academic records, attendance, and support tickets through a clean and user-friendly graphical interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Record Management System (SRMS) is designed to streamline the management of student information in educational institutions.  
The system enables administrators to manage student records, marks, attendance, and resolve student-raised tickets, while students can view their academic details and raise support tickets.

This project was developed as an **academic mini-project** to demonstrate Python GUI programming, database integration, and modular application design.
